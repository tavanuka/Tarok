# Counting
As per game, one to win must count their cards. Tarok has multiple ways that seem complicated. For that, we will use the most common (which is the easiest) one used by Slovene Tarok players.

## Card Grouping
The complexity of counting comes out of how the cards are grouped. For this ruleset, we **group them in threes** called [[Glossary#^211dba\|tricks]].

When counting in groups, it does not matter how the cards are arranged into groups. When counting in threes, take any three of your cards, then any other three and so on. Some people count them in the order they lie in the pile, but it can be easier to rearrange them to make the addition easier. Mixing the cards up and rearranging them into new groupsÂ **never changes the total value of the pile.** *[[Sources#Counting\|1]]*

## Counting by subtraction
Players count their [[Glossary#^211dba\|tricks]] by **summing the total score of the trick, minus 2.**
example: 
-   a group of three empty cards is worth one point (1 + 1 + 1 - 2)
-   a king plus two empty cards is worth 5 points (5 + 1 + 1 - 2)
-   a king, a queen and an empty card are worth 8 points (5 + 4 + 1 - 2)
-   three riders are worth 7 points (3 + 3 + 3 - 2)  *[[Sources#Counting\|2]]*
