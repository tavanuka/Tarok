# Background

This is the Slovenian version of the central European Tarot games. It is closely related to Austrian Tarock - for example the four player form is similar to Austrian [Königrufen](https://www.pagat.com/tarot/koenig.html) - but because of the differences in contracts and scoring, it is less baroque and much more competitive.

# Basic rules

## Player count
The game can be played from 2 up to 4 people. Where 2 player game has a different approach, the 3 and 4 player game is fundamentally the same, but implements calling for the king. *--add reference*

## Game description
Tarok is a gathering game meant to have fun playing it.
Technically, Tarok is a point trick game with bidding. The cards have values; players bid to decide who will be declarer; then tricks are played and the declarer's side wins if they take more than half the card points. In some contracts declarer can choose a partner by specifying a king.

# Cards
Tarok is played with a [[set_of_cards.jpg|specific set of cards]] - consisting of 54 cards in total, as follows:

- Tarok(s) *(22 cards)*
	*The following taroks are of special significance:*
	-  škis (22nd Tarok - has no roman number)
	-  Mond (XXII Tarok - highest tarok after škis)
	-  Frula (I Tarok - lowest tarok)
- Coloured *(32 cards)*
	- Hearts
	- Diamonds
	- Clubs
	- Spades

## Tarok(s)
Taroks consist of 22 cards that are often also called **trumps.** They are numbered from 1 to 21, where the 22nd has no numeric indication.
The numbers represent it's trump cards **strength** and **hierarchy.**  Higher the number, stronger the card.

**The three (Škis, Mond, Frula) trump cards are called [[Trula\|Trula]].**

##### Škis
![s.jpg|Škis](/img/user/Resources/s.jpg)
the Škis *(pronounced schkiss)* is the **highest**, 22nd trump card. Its purpose serves some what like a Joker.

##### Mond
![xxi.jpg|Mond](/img/user/Resources/xxi.jpg)
The Mond is the **second highest**, 21st trump card.

##### Additional Rules for the Mond card
1. [[Captured Mond\|Captured Mond]] *(applied for [[normal contracts\|normal contracts]])*


##### Frula (Pagat)
![i.jpg|Frula](/img/user/Resources/i.jpg)
Frula *(English name Pagat)* is the **lowest,** 1st trump card.

### Additional Rules for the Trula 
1. [[The Emperor Trick\|The Emperor Trick]] *(available for **all** contracts)*

## Coloured cards 
Each set of coloured cards is represented by four face cards, and four numeral cards.
Face cards consist of (in order of hierarchy):
1. The King
2. The Queen
3. The Caval *(English the Knight)*
4. The Jack

The Caval and the Jack are fairly similar in design, but are distinguishable by the fact that **the Caval is always riding a horse** on the face card, where **the Jack is not.**

## Card Hierarchy
Each colour has **the same face card hierarchy**, but the **numeral card hierarchy varies.**
- Red  - King, Queen, Caval, Jack, **1, 2, 3, 4**
- Black - King, Queen, Caval, Jack, **10, 9, 8, 7**

the **key variation** is that the **red** colour have inversed numeral card value, where by the **black** colour it applies the same principle as in many other card games - if the player is familiar with them.

## Card values
In Tarok, each card has a point value and at first glance complex [[Basic information/Counting\|counting]]. 
The point values of the cards are as follows:
| Card                                  | Value (Each) |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Kings                                 | 5 point      |
| Škis, Mond (XXII), Frula ( I - Pagat) | 5 point      |
| Queens                                | 4 point      |
| Cavals (Knights)                      | 3 point      |
| Jacks                                 | 2 point      |
| All other cards                  | 1 point      |
