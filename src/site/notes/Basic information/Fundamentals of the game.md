# Background

This is the Slovenian version of the central European Tarot games. It is closely related to Austrian Tarock - for example the four player form is similar to Austrian [Königrufen](https://www.pagat.com/tarot/koenig.html) - but because of the differences in contracts and scoring, it is less baroque and much more competitive.

# Basic rules

## Player count
The game can be played from 2 up to 4 people. Where 2 player game has a different approach, the 3 and 4 player game is fundamentally the same, but implements [[calling the king\|calling the king]].

## Game description
Tarok is a gathering game meant to have fun playing it.
Technically, Tarok is a point trick game with bidding. The cards have values; players bid to decide who will be declarer; then tricks are played and the declarer's side wins if they take more than half the card points. In some contracts declarer can choose a partner by specifying a king.

The winner is the one, who was able to gather **at least 35 points** out of 70 possible ones.

As per game, one to win must count their cards. Tarok has multiple ways that seem complicated. For that, we will use the most common (which is the easiest) one used by Slovene Tarok players.
