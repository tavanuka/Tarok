# Background

This is the Slovenian version of the central European Tarot games. It is closely related to Austrian Tarock - for example the four player form is similar to Austrian [Königrufen](https://www.pagat.com/tarot/koenig.html) - but because of the differences in contracts and scoring, it is less baroque and much more competitive. [[Sources#Fundamentals of the game\|1]]

# Basic rules

## Player count
The game can be played from 2 up to 4 people. Where 2 player game has a different approach, the 3 and 4 player game is fundamentally the same, but implements calling for the king. *--add reference*

## Game description
Tarok is a gathering game meant to have fun playing it.
Technically, Tarok is a point trick game with bidding. The cards have values; players bid to decide who will be declarer; then tricks are played and the declarer's side wins if they take more than half the card points. In some contracts declarer can choose a partner by specifying a king.

# Cards
Tarok is played with a [[set_of_cards.jpg|specific set of cards]] - consisting of 54 cards in total, as follows:

- Tarok(s) *(22 cards)*
	*The following taroks are of special significance:*
	-  škis (22nd Tarok - has no roman number)
	-  Mond (XXII Tarok - highest tarok after škis)
	-  Frula (I Tarok - lowest tarok) ^0809c1
- Coloured *(32 cards)*
	- Hearts
	- Diamonds
	- Clubs
	- Spades

## Tarok(s)
Taroks consist of 22 cards that are often also called **trumps.** They are numbered from 1 to 21, where the 22nd has no numeric indication.
The numbers represent it's trump cards **strength** and **hierarchy.**  Higher the number, stronger the card.

**The three (Škis, Mond, Frula) trump cards are called [[Trula\|Trula]].**

##### Škis
![s.jpg|Škis](/img/user/Resources/s.jpg)
the Škis *(pronounced schkiss)* is the **highest**, 22nd trump card. Its purpose serves some what like a Joker.

##### Mond
![xxi.jpg|Mond](/img/user/Resources/xxi.jpg)
The Mond is the **second highest**, 21st trump card.

##### Additional Rules for the Mond card
1. [[Captured Mond\|Captured Mond]] *(applied for [[normal contracts\|normal contracts]])*


##### Frula (Pagat)
![i.jpg|Frula](/img/user/Resources/i.jpg)
Frula *(English name Pagat)* is the **lowest,** 1st trump card.

### Additional Rules for the Trula 
1. [[The Emperor Trick\|The Emperor Trick]] *(available for **all** contracts)*

## Coloured cards 
Each set of coloured cards is represented by four face cards, and four numeral cards.
Face cards consist of (in order of hierarchy):
1. The King
2. The Queen
3. The Caval *(English the Knight)*
4. The Jack

The Caval and the Jack are fairly similar in design, but are distinguishable by the fact that **the Caval is always riding a horse** on the face card, where **the Jack is not.**

![sk.jpg|Spade King](/img/user/Resources/sk.jpg) ![hq.jpg|Heart Queen](/img/user/Resources/hq.jpg) ![cc.jpg|Club Caval](/img/user/Resources/cc.jpg) ![dj.jpg|Diamond Jack](/img/user/Resources/dj.jpg)

## Card Hierarchy
Each colour has **the same face card hierarchy**, but the **numeral card hierarchy varies.**
- Red  - King, Queen, Caval, Jack, **1, 2, 3, 4**
- Black - King, Queen, Caval, Jack, **10, 9, 8, 7**

the **key variation** is that the **red** colour have inversed numeral card value, where by the **black** colour it applies the same principle as in many other card games - if the player is familiar with them.

## Card values
In Tarok, each card has a point value and at first glance complex [[Basic information/Counting\|counting]]. 
The point values of the cards are as follows:
| Card                                  | Value (Each) |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Kings                                 | 5 point      |
| Škis, Mond (XXII), Frula ( I - Pagat) | 5 point      |
| Queens                                | 4 point      |
| Cavals (Knights)                      | 3 point      |
| Jacks                                 | 2 point      |
| All other cards                  | 1 point      |

# Counting
As per game, one to win must count their cards. Tarok has multiple ways that seem complicated. For that, we will use the most common (which is the easiest) one used by Slovene Tarok players.

## Card Grouping
The complexity of counting comes out of how the cards are grouped. For this ruleset, we **group them in threes** called [[Glossary#^211dba\|tricks]].

When counting in groups, it does not matter how the cards are arranged into groups. When counting in threes, take any three of your cards, then any other three and so on. Some people count them in the order they lie in the pile, but it can be easier to rearrange them to make the addition easier. Mixing the cards up and rearranging them into new groups **never changes the total value of the pile.** *[[Sources#Counting\|1]]*

## Counting by subtraction
Players count their [[Glossary#^211dba\|tricks]] by **summing the total score of the trick, minus 2.**
***example:*** 
-   a group of three empty cards is worth one point (1 + 1 + 1 - 2)
-   a king plus two empty cards is worth 5 points (5 + 1 + 1 - 2)
-   a king, a queen and an empty card are worth 8 points (5 + 4 + 1 - 2)
-   three riders are worth 7 points (3 + 3 + 3 - 2)  *[[Sources#Counting\|2]]*

## Incomplete Groups
Often enough it can happen that you are left with an odd amount of cards. Those are usually either **two odd cards** or **one odd card.**
 >When cards are counted in **threes**, an incomplete group can contain one or two cards. [[Sources#Counting\|3]]

The odd trick(s) are then counted by **subtracting only minus 1.**
 ***example:***
 - a pair (two) of [[Glossary#^f40004\|empty cards]] is worth one point (1 + 1 - 1)
 - an empty card with a [[Basic information/Cards#^0809c1\|Frula]] is worth 5 points (1 + 5 - 1)
 - a single Caval is worth 2 points (3 -1)
 - a single empty card is worth nothing (1 - 1)

## Other counting methods
There are other counting methods that can also be applied when playing Tarok. For more information, read more about
