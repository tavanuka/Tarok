# Background

This is the Slovenian version of the central European Tarot games. It is closely related to Austrian Tarock - for example the four player form is similar to Austrian [Königrufen](https://www.pagat.com/tarot/koenig.html) - but because of the differences in contracts and scoring, it is less baroque and much more competitive.

# Basic rules

## Player count
The game can be played from 2 up to 4 people. Where 2 player game has a different approach, the 3 and 4 player game is fundamentally the same, but implements [[calling the king\|calling the king]].

## Game description
Tarok is a gathering game meant to have fun playing it.
Technically, Tarok is a point trick game with bidding. The cards have values; players bid to decide who will be declarer; then tricks are played and the declarer's side wins if they take more than half the card points. In some contracts declarer can choose a partner by specifying a king.

The winner is the one, who was able to gather **at least 35 points** out of 70 possible ones.

As per game, one to win must count their cards. Tarok has multiple ways that seem complicated. For that, we will use the most common (which is the easiest) one used by Slovene Tarok players.

# Gameplay
When playing tarok, the [[Basic information/Fundamentals of the game#Three player\|Three player game]] is the most common way to play cards.
In this section, we will describe each player count game and its procedure.

## Scoring
Before diving into gameplay, **scoring is a fundamental concept** one should understand before getting into playing with more people. Only winning is not enough.

A player can either win, lose, or gain nothing when scoring. All of that is determined on what they play (either two player game or more), and what [[Basic information/Contracts/Contracts\|bidding]], [[announcements\|announcements]], or specialties are encountered.

### General fundamental of counting the score
When cards are counted, one must understand what a person has scored to write down onto the sheet of paper.

#### Winning condition
A player must achieve **at least 36 points** to consider the game a win.
When the player has won, the **achieved score** is the **difference of 35 rounded to 5.**

Example:
> A player scores 40 points. That means they have won by the difference of 5, rounding it by 5, results into 5. $(40-35 = 5)$


If the player achieves 36 or 37 points, **they have won without any difference** and get no points due to rounding. **38 points however, they win by the difference of 5.** 
> **Warning:** achieving 35 points **does not** bring a win.

| Score | $(n - 35)$ | Value |
| ----- | ---------- | ----- |
| 36    | 1          | 0     |
| 37    | 2          | 0     |
| 38    | 3          | 5     |
| 41    | 6          | 5     |
| 42    | 7          | 5     |
| 43    | 8          | 10    |
| 44    | 9          | 10    |



#### Losing condition
A player loses, if they do not achieve the threshold of at least 36 points.
The player **does not** have to write any minus points, if they have not bid to play.
However, a bid resulting in a loss, is the difference of 35 from what was the achieved score.

Example:
> A player has bid to play and lost by 20. That means they have lost by the difference of 15, on top of *x* bid.
>  $(20 - 35)+(x + y)=-15+x$ *where $x$ is whatever bid amount was bet, and $y$ are the unachieved bonuses.*
 

## Two player game
*In this game, the players do not use a [[Glossary#^786107\|Talon]], but 6 piles of cards that contain 4 cards each.*

Players can either choose or play for who will be the dealer. Rock paper scissors, or drawing the top card to determine who has the highest value.
When the dealer is chosen, he deals each person **3 sets of 5 cards.** The first set gets the player, and not the dealer. *(Player > dealer > player etc.)* 

The rest of the cards are dealt into **6 piles, where each contains 4 cards.** Each player gets **three of the six piles.** The Piles have to be **cover card facing up**.

When the cards are set, the **bidding phase** can start.
Here, the player who was dealt has the right of way. They have a choice between:
- Playing
- Passing

### Bidding to play on first turn
If the first player decided to bid **play,** they are **obligated to win and get at least 36 points.** if they **win,** their points are doubled. **Losing** however, results in the achieved points being **tripled,** and counted as **minus points.**

>*Formula: $(n-35)\times 2$ 
>*note: before multiplying, the score is rounded to by 5.*
>$(45-35)\times2=20$ 
*if the player has not achieved the threshold, the total sum is tripled.*
*Formula:* $(n-35)\times3$
*note: same rule applies as before.*


### Passing
If the first player decides to pass, the **dealers** has the same options as [[Basic information/Fundamentals of the game#Bidding to play on first turn\|mentioned above]].
if the dealer also decides to **pass,** a normal game without any specific rules is played out.
The winner is whoever achieves at least 36 points.

>The worth of the points is [[Basic information/Fundamentals of the game#Winning condition\|default]]. **no bonuses apply here.**

### Playing phase
After bidding concludes, both players turn **the first cards of their 3 piles around.**
If any of those cards are either a **Kind or a tarok,** the player is **allowed** to take them into their hand, and turn around the next card. 

>*If any further card is either of the mentioned cards above, the player can take them in the following turn.*

The first player has the right of play. Its played out as any other game.

### Pile cards
Pile cards serve as an extension of the hand, that can be seen by the opponent.
They can only be played, if the opponent has played a card. 
Once the pile card has been played, the player has to turn around the new card of the pile. 
**If the card is a king or a tarok, they are allowed to take it into the hand and turn around the next card.**

>you are not allowed to play the first card out of the pile, **unless you have no cards left in your hand.**


## Three player game
Core game mechanics do not change from the previously explained two player game, but expands on it. Two key points are bidding, and using the [[Glossary#^786107\|Talon]]. 

### Preparation
First step is to shuffle the cards. After that, 6 cards are taken from the deck and put onto the middle to form our [[Glossary#^786107\|Talon]]. The rest of 48 cards are dealt to the players equally divided into 16 cards  $(48\div3=16)$. 
Note: in case a player does not get a single Tarok in his set it must be immediately stated so that the game is reshuffled and re-dealt.

Players have to agree on the flow of the game being either Clockwise or counter-clockwise from the dealer.

## Contracts 
*(Refer to [[Basic information/Contracts/Contracts\|Contracts]] and [[Basic information/Contracts/Detailed  description of the contracts\|Detailed  description of the contracts]] for further reference.)*

Three player game use the following set of contracts:
- [[Basic information/Contracts/Detailed  description of the contracts#Klop\|Klop]] *(negative game)*
- [[Basic information/Contracts/Detailed  description of the contracts#Solo three, solo two, solo one:\|Solo three]]
- [[Basic information/Contracts/Detailed  description of the contracts#Solo three, solo two, solo one:\|Solo two]]
- [[Basic information/Contracts/Detailed  description of the contracts#Solo three, solo two, solo one:\|Solo one]]
- [[Basic information/Contracts/Detailed  description of the contracts#Berač (Beggar)\|Berač]] *(negative game)*
- [[Basic information/Contracts/Detailed  description of the contracts#Solo without\|Solo without]]
- [[Basic information/Contracts/Detailed  description of the contracts#Valat\|Valat]]

In three player game, declarer always plays alone against the other two players. The only exception is [[Basic information/Contracts/Detailed  description of the contracts#Klop\|Klop]] - leaving everyone to play for themselves.
