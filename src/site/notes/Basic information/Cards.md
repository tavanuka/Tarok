## Tarok(s)
Taroks consist of 22 cards that are often also called **trumps.** They are numbered from 1 to 21, where the 22nd has no numeric indication.
The numbers represent it's trump cards **strength** and **hierarchy.**  Higher the number, stronger the card.

**The three (Škis, Mond, Frula) trump cards are called [[Trula\|Trula]].**

##### Škis
![s.jpg|Škis](/img/user/Resources/s.jpg)
the Škis *(pronounced schkiss)* is the **highest**, 22nd trump card. Its purpose serves some what like a Joker.

##### Mond

The Mond is the **second highest**, 21st trump card.

##### Additional Rules for the Mond card

##### Frula (Pagat)
![i.jpg|Frula](/img/user/Resources/i.jpg)
Frula *(English name Pagat)* is the **lowest,** 1st trump card.

### Additional Rules for the Trula 
1. [[The Emperor Trick\|The Emperor Trick]] *(available for **all** contracts)*

## Coloured cards 
Each set of coloured cards is represented by four face cards, and four numeral cards.
Face cards consist of (in order of hierarchy):
1. The King
2. The Queen
3. The Caval *(English the Knight)*
4. The Jack

The Caval and the Jack are fairly similar in design, but are distinguishable by the fact that **the Caval is always riding a horse** on the face card, where **the Jack is not.**

## Card Hierarchy
Each colour has **the same face card hierarchy**, but the **numeral card hierarchy varies.**
- Red  - King, Queen, Caval, Jack, **1, 2, 3, 4**
- Black - King, Queen, Caval, Jack, **10, 9, 8, 7**

the **key variation** is that the **red** colour have inversed numeral card value, where by the **black** colour it applies the same principle as in many other card games - if the player is familiar with them.
