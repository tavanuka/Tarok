# Additional counting methods
This section is an extraction of [Counting from pagat.com.](https://www.pagat.com/tarot/counting.html)

## Adding a point for each trick (or group)

This is the easiest method to understand, and was certainly the original method. However it is not the fastest, so you will probably prefer to use one of the other methods once the principle is understood.

For this method, the **reduced values** of the cards are used. You simply add up the values of all your cards and then add **one extra point for each group**. ([Incomplete groups](https://www.pagat.com/tarot/counting.html#incomplete) are discussed below.)

Using this method it clearly does not matter which cards you put into which groups - the number of groups and the total of the card values remain the same.

It seems certain that in early forms of Tarot the groups originated as tricks, and the size of the groups was therefore equal to the number of players in the game. So the original method of counting was to count the reduced value for each valuable card plus one extra point for each trick taken. In most modern games the relationship between groups and tricks has been forgotten, so it is common to find, for example, a four player game in which the cards are counted in groups of three.

**Examples** (counting in threes):

-   a group of three empty cards is worth one point (nothing for the cards and one for the group)
-   a king plus two empty cards is worth 5 points (4 for the king and one for the group)
-   a king, a queen and an empty card are worth 8 points (4+3+1)
-   three riders are worth 7 points (2+2+2+1)

Note that in the extreme case of a game where the cards are counted in ones every card is a group, so you would just add one point to the value of every card. Rather than doing this it is quicker and easier just to use the nominal values.

## Using fractional values

In this method, instead of adding one point for each group we add a fraction of a point to the value of each card, to give the same result. The total value of a pile of cards is simply the sum of the **fractional** values of the cards it contains.

This method is often found in descriptions of [French Tarot](https://www.pagat.com/tarot/frtarot.html), where n=2, so the fractions are halves.

**Examples** (counting in threes):

-   a group of three empty cards is worth one point (one third of a point for each card)
-   a king plus two empty cards is worth 5 points (4 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3)
-   a king, a queen and an empty card are worth 8 points (4 1/3 + 3 1/3 + 1/3)
-   three riders are worth 7 points (two and one third points each)

## Counting the valuable cards

The **nominal** values of the cards are used, and the value of a group is worked out as follows:

-   A group consisting entirely of empty cards is worth **one point**.
-   A group containing **one** valuable card is worth the value of that card.
-   A group containing **two** valuable cards is worth **one less than** the sum of their values.
-   A group containing **three** valuable cards is worth **two less than** the sum of their values.
-   A group containing **four** valuable cards is worth **three less than** the sum of their values.

This is the most practical method, and the one that most players use to count quickly, but it can appear quite mysterious at first sight. In particular, it might not be immediately obvious using this method that the value of your pile of cards stays the same no matter how you divide it into groups. This becomes clearer if you appreciate that it is really just a streamlined version of method three (subtraction).

**Examples** (counting in threes):

-   a group of three empty cards is worth one point (by definition)
-   a king plus two empty cards is worth 5 points (the value of the king)
-   a king, a queen and an empty card are worth 8 points (5 + 4 - 1)
-   three riders are worth 7 points (3 + 3 + 3 - 2)

In practice, when using this method, it helps to rearrange the cards you are counting so that as far as possible there is just one valuable card in each group.
