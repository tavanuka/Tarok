# Foreword

In this documentation, I will bind together a comprehensive, yet beginner-friendly emphasised ruleset library of the Slovene card variation of the game Tarok (written Tarock in English).
There are many extensive guides and pages that already describe the game best - but for my taste do not capture the essence and key points that are beginner friendly, thus decided to generate a documentation that would encourage faster learning of modified rules that have been surrounding me since I was a child, and put them into my words for further reference, easy accessibility and spreading the game of Tarok to other people.

# Source interpretation

As previously mentioned, there are many available sources online and in physical form provided by various websites and its communities and are very good - however, not all sources are in English. Therefore, the documentation will be cross-referenced and translated to ensure structure, integrity, and reference to according content from its reference.

*for brevity, I will **exclude** footer citation links and provide references in a separate file [[Sources\|Sources]] with annotations and according names.

# Glossary

Many words might be foreign or confusing at first glance. For better comprehension of the documentation, There will be [[Glossary\|an appended glossary]] to help you understand the words in detail. 
The documentation will be maintained to an understandable language, easily accessible for anyone able to communicate with basic to intermediate knowledge of English.
