# Foreword

In this documentation, I will bind together a comprehensive, yet beginner-friendly emphasised ruleset library of the Slovene card variation of the game Tarok (written Tarock in English).
There are many extensive guides and pages that already describe the game best - but for my taste do not capture the essence and key points that are beginner friendly, thus decided to generate a documentation that would encourage faster learning of modified rules that have been surrounding me since I was a child, and put them into my words for further reference, easy accessibility and spreading the game of Tarok to other people.
****
# Source interpretation

As previously mentioned, there are many available sources online and in physical form provided by various websites and its communities and are very good - however, not all sources are in English. Therefore, the documentation will be cross-referenced and translated to ensure structure, integrity, and reference to according content from its reference.

*for brevity, I will **exclude** footer citation links and provide references in a separate file [[Sources\|Sources]] with annotations and according names.*
****
# Glossary

Many words might be foreign or confusing at first glance. For better comprehension of the documentation, There will be [[Glossary\|an appended glossary]] to help you understand the words in detail. 
The documentation will be maintained to an understandable language, easily accessible for anyone able to communicate with basic to intermediate knowledge of English.

To start your introduction to the game, head over to [[Basic information/Fundamentals of the game\|Fundamentals of the game]].
